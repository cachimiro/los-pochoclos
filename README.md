Deployment
My website was created using Cloud9 on AWS and I created an external repository on GitHub and linked it to heroku.

I created a new environment in Cloud9.
Created all my folders and files.
Inside the bash terminal, entered 'git init'.
Entered 'git add .' into the terminal.
Entered 'git commit' into the terminal and created my initial commit.
Followed the below steps to deploy the site to GitHub pages.
This Project was deployed also with Heroku in the following way:

Create Heroku account
Login into Heroku from console heroku login
Create a new empty App on Heroku as none was created before heroku create
Rename App heroku apps: rename my-recipe-cookbook Run this command from App's Root. The empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository. Check git remote -v
Create a Procfile (instruction to Heroku as which file should be used as an entry point for our App) The Procfile must be in your appâ€™s root directory echo web python run.py > Procfile
Create a requirements.txt file sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
To deploy git push heroku master
Set the IP,PORT, SECRET_KEY and any other environment variables in Heroku Account Settings
